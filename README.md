# E-Learning Site

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About the Project 
It is an e-learning platform that offers the ability to sign up for any course, watch the associated videos, and access many additional services including an admin panel and instructor-related tools.

## Need for E-Learning Site
E-learning methods and technology are important both for educating students and for the professional development of employees in the workforce.

In the mid-2000s, the American Society for Training and Development (ASTD) estimated that 75% of the U.S. workforce would need retraining within the coming five years in order to keep pace with industry needs and increasing global competition. Hewlett-Packard estimated that the half-life of a bachelor's degree in engineering could be as short as 18 months.

Today, the need for employees to keep pace with an increasingly rapid evolution of technology has only grown. For example, expert coders, hardware developers and online security professionals alike anticipate the advent of quantum computing to create a massive shift in the way modern businesses operate. This strongly necessitates new workforce training and education as well as new methods of delivering it that allow increased adaptability in the rapidly changing environment.

## Quick Start

```bash


# Install dependencies
cd E-Learning-MERN && npm install
cd E-Learning-MERN && cd client && npm install

```
Create account in Mongo Atlas and create cluster. Get your MongoURI by following the instructions and add it in keys.js file which is inside the config folder. 

```
secretOrKey=ANY_SECRET
mongoURI: 'YOUR_URI'

```

To run the development server:

```bash
# the development server runs on port 3000
npm run dev
```

To run production build:

```bash
# create code bundle
npm run build

# run production server
npm run prod
```
---

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

Updated with clarifications & additions.ine of text in a code that is not a comment or blank line, and also header lines, in any case of the number of statements or fragments of statements on the line. LOC clearly consists of all lines containing the declaration.

### Next Step
Research has shown a rough correlation between LOC and the overall cost and length of developing a project/ product in Software Development, and between LOC and the number of defects. This means the

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

## About React
React is not a framework. It is just a library developed by Facebook to solve some problems that we were facing earlier. Learning any new framework or library is exciting but before that, we have to get the concept of that library or framework. To get the concept of React you need to know what basic things are used in React.

The list of ReactJS Main Concepts are listed below:

ReactJS Introduction to JSX
ReactJS Rendering Elements
ReactJS Components
ReactJS Components – Set 2
ReactJS Props – Set 1
ReactJS Props – Set 2
ReactJS State in React
ReactJS Lifecycle of Components
ReactJS Conditional Rendering
ReactJS Lists
ReactJS Keys
ReactJS forms
